**A List of Big Models**

</div>

# Introduction

Welcome to BMList! We wish to use this list to show the recent trend of big models.

In BMList, we list models that:

1. Have at least 1 billion parameters;
2. Have been publicly released either by a paper, an artice or a piece of news;
3. Focus on text processing (we promise other models like vision or code models are coming soon!).

If you find any typos or mistakes in this repo, please feel free to raise issues or pull requests!


# Demos

We find that it is not intuitive to show all information about big models in a GitHub repo. So we use this repo to store raw data and provide two ways to present more information.


## Multi-dimensional Table

We show all information of big models in a [multi-dimensional table](https://a0qwpgc3qv.feishu.cn/base/bascn2lp9dYCNe6GKdRd5sfPwhd), which is easy to classify models by organizations/languages.

## Big Model Gallery

We publish a [website]() to show statistics of big models. 

Now we present three figures for interested users, and we welcome ideas for new figures.

### Model Numbers by Organizations

### Model Parameters by Organizations

(In this figure we simply add up parameter sizes of each model published by each organization)

# Contribution

We welcome everyone to add new models. Please check our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMList/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how to contribute.

Once you added a model, the multi-dimensional table and the website will be updated. Don't worry about that!
